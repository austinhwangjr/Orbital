Licensee shall not create a combination mark consisting of any of the Trademarks with the proprietary marks of any other Person. Licensee shall not take any action that 
could reasonably be expected to impair the registrability, validity or enforceability of any of the Trademarks, nor shall Licensee attempt to register, use or aid any 
third party in attempting to register or use, in any jurisdiction, any trademark or service mark which may, in the reasonable opinion of Licensor, infringe or otherwise 
violate Licensor’s rights to the Trademarks.

circumstances. To the extent upgrades or updates are provided, they shall be provided to Licensee on a license exchange basis, and Licensee agrees that by using an upgrade 
or update Licensee voluntarily terminates Licensee’s right to use any previous version of the Licensed Software. Upgrades and updates may be licensed with additional or different

or quiet enjoyment.

damages to any computer or loss of data that results from the download or use of the Licensed Software.

lost profits or lost savings, loss of goodwill, business interruption, work stoppage, loss of data, or computer failure, damage or malfunction, or for any claim by any party, even 
if licensor has been apprised of the possibility of such damages, and regardless of the theory (including contract, tort, strict liability, negligence or otherwise) upon which such 
claim is based. In no event shall Licensor’s total liability to Licensee for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed 
the amount paid by Licensee under this agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above-stated remedy fails of its essential purpose. Licensor and Licensee acknowledge
